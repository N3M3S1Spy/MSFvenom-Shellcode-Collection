This repository provides an extensive collection of shellcodes generated using **MSFvenom**. Shellcodes are categorized by operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android), architecture (x86, x64, ARM, etc.), and payload type (reverse, bind, staged, stageless, etc.). The goal is to serve as a centralized reference for penetration testers, malware analysts, reverse engineers, and cybersecurity researchers.

**Features:**
- All major payload types: `meterpreter`, `shell`, `exec`, `download_exec`, and more  
- Both staged and stageless variants  
- Well-structured directories by OS and architecture  
- Optional MSFvenom command used for generation included  
- Regular updates based on new MSFvenom releases  

**Disclaimer:**  
For **educational and research purposes only**. Use only in legal, controlled environments with proper authorization.
